# hello-world
My first repository =)
Hi, I'm Julio and I've finally decided to try and learn about GitHub. I am really curious on finding out what GitHub can do for my Web Projects.
Currently trying to learn more about JavaScript. I've worked on small projects with HTML, CSS, JS, C#, ASP.NET and SQL Server.
